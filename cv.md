## About Me
Hello, I am 31 years old and I live in Minsk, Belarus.
This year I decided to change my specialty, I have long wanted to become a developer. I have been working with the security system for a long time, but it bothers me. I have reached a fairly high level in the video surveillance system.
All this was the reason that I decided to try myself in a new field, on the advice of a friend, I went to RSSchool. From personal qualities, I want to note purposefulness, the ability to google and look for answers to questions.
