## About Me
I have been working with a security system for a long time, but for me it gets boring. I have reached quite a high level in the video surveillance system. I donâ€™t see development in my area.
All this was the reason why I decided to try myself in a new field, on the advice of a friend, I went to RSSchool.
From personal qualities I want to note purposefulness, the ability to google and look for answers to questions.
